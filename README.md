# AEMS (Aptiv Electronic Mangement System)

This application lets users keep track of items. Users can be assigned different items from admins. Admins can add new items, update items , and delete items as needed. Items can be viewed, sorted by categories and users.

Users can have one of two statuses, 'admin' or 'default'. Admins can add new items, update items, and delete items as needed. Items can be viewed by category or all together by anyone. Admins can add notes to items, and assign instances of items to users.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Next JS, Tailwind, MUI , SCSS, Express, Mongo DB, bCrypt, passport js

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
